# Changelog

## 0.8.34 (build 1030)

### Fixed

- USB Device Settings now reads and writes the optical format for output-capable cards, so Card 2 correctly shows ADAT/SMUX and S/PDIF when using the 16 Analog In / 16 Digital Out configuration.
- USB optical-format changes now wait for a confirmed hardware readback, preventing the picker from reverting or showing a stale selection immediately after a change.

### Release notes

- This release keeps the existing 0.8.x version continuity and ThunderBridge driver build 119.
- The packaged installer is the recommended installation path. Building from source requires Apple DriverKit entitlements and private signing credentials; see [`docs/BUILDING.md`](docs/BUILDING.md).
- Sparkle update signing remains controlled by the project maintainer. The public source does not include the private signing key.
